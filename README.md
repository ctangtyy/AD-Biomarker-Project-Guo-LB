# AD-Biomarker-Project-Guo-LB
All code for the AD Biomarker Project with the Guo Lab will be updated here as we continue to create scripts to not only organize but also analyze Abeta measurements in patient samples from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
We are currently harnessing Python, a proprietary source software, in conjunction with an array of packages, including numpy, pandas, and biopython, for our project. These tools enable us to craft code designed for both visual representation and in-depth statistical analysis. Our forward-looking approach includes the development of an intuitive UI/UX interface that will offer seamless interaction with the data for users, including researchers.
